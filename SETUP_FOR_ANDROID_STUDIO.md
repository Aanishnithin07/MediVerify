## üõ† **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

**1. Flutter not recognized:**
```bash
# Make sure Flutter is in PATH
echo $PATH | grep flutter
# If not found, add to ~/.zshrc:
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin"
```

**2. Android license issues:**
```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
# Accept all licenses
```

**3. Backend connection issues:**
- Make sure backend is running on port 8001
- Check if `http://localhost:8001/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- Firewall might be blocking - temporarily disable or allow port 8001

**4. Camera permissions:**
- Android: Permissions are handled automatically by Flutter
- If issues persist, check app settings and grant camera permission manually

**5. Build errors:**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
